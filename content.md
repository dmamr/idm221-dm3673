*Website redesign. Software used: Figma.* November – February 2022-2023.

“Greek from Greece” is a restaurant with Greek cuisine based in Philadelphia, PA. Their website was a little intimidating (buttons’ abundance) and old-fashioned, so I redesigned it as a part of my university project. I conducted a full analysis of the target audience, opponents’ websites, and their current website prior to creating my own representation.

A4 paper posters. Software used: Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop. Captured on: iPhone 11.

An eating disorder has irreversible repercussions on lives. Yet, it is not customary to speak about it to a vast audience in my country. I was eager to stop the silence and raise awareness of such an acute problem. I strived to prevent people from committing my mistakes. And when the concept took shape in my head, I started its realization.

3. Photography

Saint Petersburg Essentials

August 2023

Captured on: Canon EOS Rebet T7.

When you grow older, trips with your parents take on new colors. You observe what's happening around you from a fresh perspective, absorbing as many images as possible. Antique buildings in the Baroque style stand tall on the wide streets of St. Petersburg. Threads are stretched between the lampposts, and beneath them, cars speed by while pedestrians walk confidently—everyone is in a hurry somewhere. Amidst this hustle and bustle, you can distinguish the tourists leisurely strolling and looking around in an attempt to soak in the city's energy. This collection of photographs was created as a memory of a warm trip organized by my parents.

4. Love Blossom

July 2023

Captured on: Canon EOS Rebet T7.

My elder brother has always been the closest person to me. I could not believe when I was told his family was expecting a baby, even after I had seen his wife's grown baby belly. Seeing the love between partners and their anticipation of a little miracle is inspiring. This photoshoot was made to capture the essence of the moment -  the happiness of a young family.
